I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Toronto, specializing in applied microeconomics. My research interests are at the intersection of urban and labour economics and include sustainable urban growth, gentrification, regional inequality, and public safety.

I completed my Master of Arts in Economics at the University of British Columbia, and hold Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics from Mount Allison University.
